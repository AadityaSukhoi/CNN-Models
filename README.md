# 🧠 CNN-Models
Welcome to CNN-Models, my personal repo of convolutional neural network (CNN) projects. I'm currently learning and experimenting with CNNs through hands-on projects in Google Colab — each notebook here is a different model trained on a real-world dataset. 🧪🔥

## 📚 What You'll Find Here
| Project | Dataset | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **MNIST** | Built-in Tensorflow Dataset | Basic CNN for handwritten digit classification |
| **Blood Cancer Detection** | [Blood Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumithsingh/blood-cell-images-for-cancer-detection) | Classifying blood cancer cells using image data |
| **Tuberculosis Detection** | [Chest X-Ray Dataset (TB)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset) | CNN model to detect TB from chest X-ray images |
| **Breast Cancer Detection** | [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) | Classifies malignant vs. benign breast cancer cells |
| **Pneumonia Detection** | [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) | Detects pneumonia from chest X-ray scans |


## 💡 Goals of This Repo
📈 Understand the architecture and inner workings of CNNs

🔍 Explore medical imaging datasets and apply CNNs to real-world problems

🧪 Experiment with different model architectures and techniques (e.g., data augmentation, transfer learning, etc.)

📝 Keep track of my progress and build a neat little portfolio of deep learning work

## 🚀 How to Use
Open the Colab notebook for the project you’re interested in.

Follow along, or run the code yourself.

Feel free to fork the repo and try your own tweaks!

Note: All notebooks are set up for Google Colab, so you don’t need to worry about setting up a local environment.
